# SolAI Configuration

The canonical configuration for the SolAI stack lives in the repository root at `config.yml`. Copy that file into this directory as `config.yml` (or override it via the `SOLAI_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable) when packaging deployments that expect configuration files inside `config/`.
